description: What I've learned dealing with so many side projects and never finishing any of them.
---

I have loads of side projects, and I haven't finished any of them. But, I know
for sure that each project has helped me in some way or other, even if I didn't
manage to complete them or finish my initial roadmaps.

I try to use a new technology in each project, even if I only touch the surface of the many possibilities 
using that technology. For example for this portfolio I've used [Astro](https://astro.build), 
something I was entirely new to before starting.

Even with that advantage, it can be still challenging for me to stay focused and allocate sufficient time 
and energy to each project. Sometimes I just give up half way through some of them.

Side projects often involve experimenting with new technologies or techniques. While this can be a great learning
experience, as I've mentioned before, it also leads to encountering complex technical challenges that may require 
more time and effort to overcome. Sometimes I even give up based on these challenges...

## What I've learned

Managing side projects requires a delicate balance. While they offer valuable
learning experiences and prevent boredom, they also demand focus,
prioritization, and perseverance. Moving forward, I aim to approach my side
projects with a more disciplined mindset, carefully selecting and committing to
a manageable number of projects. By doing so, I hope to increase my chances of
completing them and reaping the full benefits of my efforts.
