*This post refers to the 3rd iteration of this site. The most up-to-date post is available [here](/blog/astro).*    

I've gone through many iterations of my blog and main website over the years,
and the end result of all those changes has been consistent throughout: they've
gotten simpler and simpler. I just love simplicity, and most of my personal
websites reflect that.

The idiom really puts it well: _the less said, the better_. I don't like bulky
layouts full of useless data or flamboyant animations. Sure, it's nice to show
off, but I believe the information should be clear at first glance.

# Blog redesign

Every now and then I get an urge to redesign my website(s). Sometimes it's a new
design fad, sometimes I feel like the website is outdated.

This time it's based heavily off of [Paco Coursey](https://paco.me)'s website. I
felt like the previous iteration was just way too crowded. This time, it's
beautiful, it gets the point across and it's simple. It's one of those site
layouts that I really have a soft spot for. It reminds me of
[Notion](https://notion.so) a bit.
